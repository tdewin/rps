Restore Point Simulator for Veeam

The Restore Point Simulator (RPS) allows you to simulate restore points created by Veeam Backup & Replication. This allows you to better understand what specific settings do in the scheduler and the impact on backup size. Alternatively you can use it to size a backup repository

Live version can be found on http://vee.am/rps or just the master branch dev version here http://tdewin.github.io/rps/
